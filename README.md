# Diabetic Foot Ulcer Detection and Monitoring

Project carried out with the cooperation of IST and ETSIT.

**Project Description:**

This project focuses on the early detection and monitoring of diabetic foot ulcers using machine learning techniques. Diabetic foot ulcers are a severe complication of diabetes that can lead to amputations and even mortality. Early detection and treatment are crucial to prevent these ulcers from worsening.

Our approach involves training a fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN) using images of diabetic patients' feet to recognize ulcerations. Machine learning offers an objective and automated method for identifying early signs of diabetic foot ulcers. This automated system is necessary due to the prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers and the need for regular screenings. By efficiently analyzing a large volume of images, our system enables early detection and timely interventions for a broader patient population.

The choice of CNN architecture, such as ResNet50, DenseNet121, or EfficientNetB2, plays a significant role in achieving the best performance. We have selected these architectures based on extensive evaluations, considering factors like computational efficiency and classification accuracy.

**Key Features:**

- Early detection of diabetic foot ulcers using machine learning.
- Utilizes fine-tuned CNN architectures for accurate classification.
- Monitors ulcer progression over time to assess risk and enable early intervention.

**Getting Started:**

To get started with this project, you'll need:

- Python environment with necessary libraries (NumPy, TensorFlow, etc.).
- Access to the dataset of diabetic foot images (provided or sourced separately).
- Configuration of the chosen CNN architecture (e.g., ResNet50).

**Usage:**

Our system can be used for:

- Detecting diabetic foot ulcers in medical images.
- Monitoring ulcer progression and assessing risk.
- Providing valuable information for healthcare professionals to intervene early.

**Contributing:**

We welcome contributions to improve the accuracy and generalizability of our approach, especially in handling varying visual characteristics of diabetic foot ulcers. You can contribute by reporting issues, suggesting improvements, or submitting pull requests.
